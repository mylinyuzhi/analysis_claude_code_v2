## 2.1.111

- Claude Opus 4.7 xhigh is now available! Use /effort to tune speed vs. intelligence
- Auto mode is now available for Max subscribers when using Opus 4.7
- Added `xhigh` effort level for Opus 4.7, sitting between `high` and `max`. Available via `/effort`, `--effort`, and the model picker; other models fall back to `high`
- `/effort` now opens an interactive slider when called without arguments, with arrow-key navigation between levels and Enter to confirm
- Added "Auto (match terminal)" theme option that matches your terminal's dark/light mode — select it from `/theme`
- Added `/less-permission-prompts` skill — scans transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls and proposes a prioritized allowlist for `.claude/settings.json`
- Added `/ultrareview` for running comprehensive code review in the cloud using parallel multi-agent analysis and critique — invoke with no arguments to review your current branch, or `/ultrareview <PR#>` to fetch and review a specific GitHub PR
- Auto mode no longer requires `--enable-auto-mode`
- Windows: PowerShell tool is progressively rolling out. Opt in or out with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL`. On Linux and macOS, enable with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_POWERSHELL_TOOL=1` (requires `pwsh` on PATH)
- Read-only bash commands with glob patterns (e.g. `ls *.ts`) and commands starting with `cd <project-dir> &&` no longer trigger a permission prompt
- Suggest the closest matching subcommand when `claude <word>` is invoked with a near-miss typo (e.g. `claude udpate` → "Did you mean `claude update`?")
- Plan files are now named after your prompt (e.g. `fix-auth-race-snug-otter.md`) instead of purely random words
- Improved `/setup-vertex` and `/setup-bedrock` to show the actual `settings.json` path when `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is set, seed model candidates from existing pins on re-run, and offer a "with 1M context" option for supported models
- `/skills` menu now supports sorting by estimated token count — press `t` to toggle

- Transcript view footer now shows `[` (dump to scrollback) and `v` (open in editor) shortcuts
- The "+N lines" marker for truncated long pastes is now a full-width rule for easier scanning
- Headless `--output-format stream-json` now includes `plugin_errors` on the init event when plugins are demoted for unsatisfied dependencies
- Added `OTEL_LOG_RAW_API_BODIES` environment variable to emit full API request and response bodies as OpenTelemetry log events for debugging
- Suppressed spurious decompression, network, and transient error messages that could appear in the TUI during normal operation
- Reverted the v2.1.110 cap on non-streaming fallback retries — it traded long waits for more outright failures during API overload
- Fixed terminal display tearing (random characters, drifting input) in iTerm2 + tmux setups when terminal notifications are sent
- Fixed `@` file suggestions re-scanning the entire project on every turn in non-git working directories, and showing only config files in freshly-initialized git repos with no tracked files
- Fixed LSP diagnostics from before an edit appearing after it, causing the model to re-read files it just edited
- Fixed tab-completing `/resume` immediately resuming an arbitrary titled session instead of showing the session picker
- Fixed `/context` grid rendering with extra blank lines between rows
- Fixed `/clear` dropping the session name set by `/rename`, causing statusline output to lose `session_name`
- Improved plugin error handling: dependency errors now distinguish conflicting, invalid, and overly complex version requirements; fixed stale resolved versions after `plugin update`; `plugin install` now recovers from interrupted prior installs
- Fixed Claude calling a non-existent `commit` skill and showing "Unknown skill: commit" for users without a custom `/commit` command
- Fixed 429 rate-limit errors on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry referencing status.claude.com (it only covers Anthropic-operated providers)
- Fixed feedback surveys appearing back-to-back after dismissing one
- Fixed bare URLs in bash/PowerShell/MCP tool output being unclickable when the terminal wraps them across lines
- Windows: `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` and SessionStart hook environment files now apply (previously a no-op)
- Windows: permission rules with drive-letter paths are now correctly root-anchored, and paths differing only by drive-letter case are recognized as the same path

## 2.1.110

- Added `autoScrollEnabled` config to disable conversation auto-scroll in fullscreen mode
- Added option to show Claude's last response as commented context in the `Ctrl+G` external editor (enable via `/config`)

## 2.1.108

- Added `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H` env var to opt into 1-hour prompt cache TTL on API key, Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry (`ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H_BEDROCK` is deprecated but still honored), and `FORCE_PROMPT_CACHING_5M` to force 5-minute TTL
- Added recap feature to provide context when returning to a session, configurable in `/config` and manually invocable with `/recap`; force with `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_AWAY_SUMMARY` if telemetry disabled.
- The model can now discover and invoke built-in slash commands like `/init`, `/review`, and `/security-review` via the Skill tool
- `/undo` is now an alias for `/rewind`
- Improved `/model` to warn before switching models mid-conversation, since the next response re-reads the full history uncached
- Improved `/resume` picker to default to sessions from the current directory; press `Ctrl+A` to show all projects
- Improved error messages: server rate limits are now distinguished from plan usage limits; 5xx/529 errors show a link to status.claude.com; unknown slash commands suggest the closest match

- Changed `--resume` picker to no longer show sessions created by `claude -p` or SDK invocations
- Removed `Get-DnsClientCache` and `ipconfig /displaydns` from auto-allow (DNS cache privacy)
